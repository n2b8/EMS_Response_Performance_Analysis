Data Dictionary: EMS Operations Hourly Data
==================================================

General Information:
- Dataset Name: EMS Operations Hourly Data
- Description: This data provides hourly aggregates of various operational and environmental features for a 911 urban EMS (ambulance) system, which handles approximately 130,000 911 medical and trauma calls annually.
- Date Range: 11/1/2014 - 11/1/2024
- Source: Aggregated from CAD (Computer-Aided Dispatch) SQL database.
- Key Notes: Some metrics are not consistently collected over time and may require imputation or cleaning.

==================================================

Column Descriptions:
year:
  The year in which the data was recorded.

month:
  The month in which the data was recorded.

day:
  The day of the month when the data was recorded.

day_of_week:
  The day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday) for the recorded data.

hour:
  The hour of the day (0-23) when the data was recorded.

incident_count:
  Count of incidents entered into the CAD system. These do not always result in a response.

dist_mean:
  Average distance from the location of the resource at assignment time to the location of the scene, measured in miles (as the crow flies).

perc_from_hosp:
  Percentage of resources dispatched to calls from a hospital, often leading to potential response delays.

base_ed_divert:
  Binary indicator for the main hospital and trauma center diversion status.

system_overload:
  Arbitrary status set by management to indicate critical system overload. Overrides hospital choice to transport to the nearest appropriate facility.

weather_status:
  Severe weather status, functioning similarly to system_overload. Emergent calls during this status are excluded from response time compliance calculations.

RTC:
  Response Time Compliance based on the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 1710. NFPA Standard 1710 establishes a 60-second 'turnout time' and 480-second 'travel time' (together, 540 seconds or 9-minute 'response time') benchmark for the arrival of an ALS unit at an emergency medical incident in not less than 90% of dispatched incidents.

emergent_responses:
  Count of emergency responses dispatched during the hour.

non_emergent_responses:
  Count of non-emergency responses dispatched during the hour.

mean_response_all:
  Average response time for all incidents during the hour, measured in seconds.

mean_response_emergent:
  Average response time for emergency incidents, measured in seconds.

mean_response_non_emergent:
  Average response time for non-emergency incidents, measured in seconds.

percentile_90_response_all:
  90th percentile of response times for all incidents during the hour, measured in seconds.

percentile_90_response_emergent:
  90th percentile of response times for emergency incidents, measured in seconds.

percentile_90_response_non_emergent:
  90th percentile of response times for non-emergency incidents, measured in seconds.

bls_ambulances:
  Number of Basic Life Support ambulances active during the hour.

satellite_ambulances:
  ALS ambulances that start and end shifts at satellite stations rather than the base hospital.

als_ambulances:
  Number of Advanced Life Support ambulances active during the hour.

fly_cars:
  ALS-capable solo personnel vehicles that quickly respond to calls. These are non-transport units typically used in high-volume areas.

total_cars:
  Total number of vehicles active during the hour, including ALS, BLS, satellite, and fly cars.

non_emergent_transports:
  Count of transports for non-emergency cases during the hour.

emergent_transports:
  Count of transports for emergency cases during the hour.

chute_times_all:
  Average chute time (elapsed time between resource assignment and when it starts moving) for all incidents, measured in seconds.

chute_times_non_emergent:
  Average chute time for non-emergency incidents, measured in seconds.

chute_times_emergent:
  Average chute time for emergency incidents, measured in seconds.

temperature:
  Average temperature during the hour.

rain:
  Amount of rainfall during the hour.

snowfall:
  Amount of snowfall during the hour.
